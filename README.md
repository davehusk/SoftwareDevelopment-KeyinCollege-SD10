# SoftwareDevelopment-KeyinCollege-SD10

This is a directory for the files used for my Software Development course at Keyin College.

I have other repositories made which are still connected to github urls with marks I havn't 
been graded yet. Once I do I will be able to re-organize everything again for good now that
I understand GitHub better.  Thanks- Dave
